In addition I want to thank Mario Krüger and Patrick Huhn who have helped me a lot throughout the work on my thesis and in general during my time in this working group. I also want to thank all other members of the working group for their valuable feedback and insight during group meetings. \\
Last but not least I want to thank my family and my friends for supporting me during my studies. In particular I want to thank Marvin Hemmer for the private as well as work related conversations throughout the work on this thesis, as well as Patrick Teeuwen who supported me strongly since I have known him.
